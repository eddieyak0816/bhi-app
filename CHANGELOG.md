# CHANGELOG

## 2026-01-25 — dev
- Added Admin UI: tag-manager, criteria (logic_rules) CRUD, inline lab-marker creation, bulk-delete, CSV export. (`src/pages/Admin.tsx`)
- Server: admin endpoints for `tags`, `logic_rules`, `lab_markers`, `resources` bulk-delete and `delete-by-attrs` fallback; audit logging added. (`server/index.js`)
- Database: `tags` table + seed updates; optional migration to add `id` to `logic_rules` created. (`db/tags.sql`, `db/migrations/20260120_add_logic_rules_id_optional.sql`)
- Tests: expanded Playwright coverage for Admin flows; hardened selectors and added API-fallback cleanup. (`tests/admin.spec.ts`)
- CI: added schema validator and `ASSISTANT_PREFERENCES.md` enforcement workflow; Playwright runner adjustments to avoid remote browser-download failures.

## Pending
- Tenant RLS: enable & validate in staging; backfill tenant_id where required.
- Hosted uploads: presigned URL flow + preview UI + retention policy.
- CI: split E2E into dedicated job and stabilise remote runs.
